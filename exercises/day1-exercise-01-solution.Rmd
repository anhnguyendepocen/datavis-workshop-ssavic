## Exercise 1: Scatterplot

```{r exercise-01}
ggplot(crampton.pig, aes(weight1, weight2, color = treatment, size = feed)) + 
  geom_point()
```

## Exercise 2: Tile plot

```{r exercise-02}
ggplot(crampton.pig, aes(rep, treatment, fill = weight2 - weight1)) + 
  geom_tile(color = "black", size = 2)
```

## Exercise 3: Density plot

```{r exercise-03}
ggplot(crampton.pig, aes(weight2 - weight1, fill = treatment)) + 
  geom_density(alpha = 0.7) 
```

## Exercise 4: Grouped barplot

```{r exercise-04}
ggplot(crampton.pig, aes(treatment, feed, fill = rep)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge")
```

## Exercise 5: Rose plot

```{r exercise-05}
ggplot(crampton.pig, aes(treatment, feed, fill = rep)) + 
  geom_col(position = "dodge") + coord_polar("x")
```

## Exercise 6: Boxplot

```{r exercise-06}
ggplot(heart2, aes(heart_disease, obesity, fill = family_history)) + 
  geom_boxplot()
```

## Exercise 7: Dotplot

```{r exercise-07}
ggplot(heart2, aes(heart_disease, obesity, fill = family_history)) + 
  geom_dotplot(binaxis = "y", stackdir = "center",
               position = "dodge")
```

## Exercise 8: Violin plot

```{r exercise-08}
ggplot(heart2, aes(heart_disease, obesity, fill = family_history)) + 
  geom_violin()
```

## Exercise 9: 2D density plot

```{r exercise-09}
ggplot(heart2, aes(age, obesity)) + 
  geom_density_2d_filled()
```

## Exercise 10: Hexagonal heatmap

```{r exercise-10}
ggplot(heart2, aes(age, obesity)) + 
  geom_hex()
```
